7. On August 15, 2024, the 30-day cure period expired without CloudSystems providing adequate remedy or returning the outsourced work in-house as demanded.

8. On August 20, 2024, TechVentures sent a Notice of Termination, demanding return of all proprietary materials and the $150,000 advance payment.

9. On September 3, 2024, CloudSystems refused to return the payment, claiming entitlement to the funds for "work completed" despite the material breach.

10. On September 15, 2024, TechVentures discovered through industry sources that CloudSystems had begun marketing a similar inventory management system to TechVentures' direct competitors.

11. On October 1, 2024, TechVentures filed this action seeking damages, restitution, and injunctive relief.

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA
COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO

CASE NO. CGC-24-587654

TECHVENTURES LLC,
    Plaintiff,

v.

CLOUDSYSTEMS INC.,
    Defendant.

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff TechVentures LLC respectfully moves this Court for summary judgment on all causes of action asserted in the First Amended Complaint. The undisputed material facts establish that Defendant CloudSystems Inc. materially breached the parties' Software Development Agreement through unauthorized delegation of core contractual duties, misappropriation of confidential information, and retention of payments to which it has no legal entitlement. There are no genuine issues of material fact, and Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

II. STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS

The following material facts are established by competent evidence and are not genuinely disputed:

    1. On March 15, 2024, the parties entered into a valid and binding Software Development Agreement. (UMF 1)
    
    2. The Agreement explicitly prohibited delegation of development work without Plaintiff's written consent. (UMF 2)
    
    3. Plaintiff performed all conditions precedent to Defendant's performance, including providing specifications and making milestone payments. (UMF 3)
    
    4. Defendant systematically outsourced core development work to unauthorized third-party contractors from April through June 2024. (UMF 4)
    
    5. Defendant concealed this outsourcing while providing false progress reports to Plaintiff. (UMF 5)
    
    6. Plaintiff provided timely notice of breach and opportunity to cure, which Defendant failed to remedy. (UMF 6)
    
    7. Following termination, Defendant began marketing competing products using Plaintiff's proprietary information. (UMF 7)

III. LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate where "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine issues of material fact. Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 (2001).

IV. ARGUMENT

    A. Defendant Materially Breached the Software Development Agreement
    
        1. The Contract Terms Are Clear and Unambiguous
        
        Under California law, contract interpretation begins with the plain language of the agreement. When contract terms are clear and explicit, they govern. Civ. Code § 1638. Here, Section 7.3 of the Agreement unambiguously states: "Developer shall not delegate any portion of the development work without Client's prior written consent."
        
        2. Defendant's Unauthorized Delegation Constituted Material Breach
        
        The evidence conclusively establishes that Defendant violated this core provision through systematic outsourcing. (See Exs. E-G.) California courts recognize that unauthorized delegation of personal service contracts constitutes material breach. Taylor v. Johnston, 15 Cal.3d 130, 137 (1975).
    
    B. Defendant Breached Confidentiality Obligations
    
        1. The Agreement Imposed Strict Confidentiality Requirements
        
        Section 8 of the Agreement required Defendant to maintain the confidentiality of Plaintiff's proprietary information and prohibited disclosure to third parties without appropriate safeguards.
        
        2. Defendant's Unauthorized Disclosures Violated These Obligations
        
        The undisputed evidence shows that Defendant's subcontractors had unfettered access to Plaintiff's trade secrets without any confidentiality protections. (Ex. H.) This constitutes a clear breach of Defendant's contractual duties.
    
    C. Plaintiff Is Entitled to Damages and Injunctive Relief
    
        1. Direct and Consequential Damages Are Readily Calculable
        
        Plaintiff is entitled to restitution of the $150,000 advance payment and $450,000 in cover costs for completing the project with a replacement vendor. (Exs. P, Q.)
        
        2. Injunctive Relief Is Warranted to Prevent Ongoing Harm
        
        Defendant's continued use of Plaintiff's trade secrets causes irreparable harm that cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Code Civ. Proc. § 526(a).

V. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant summary judgment in Plaintiff's favor on all claims, award damages as established by the evidence, issue appropriate injunctive relief, and grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

MORRISON & ASSOCIATES LLP

## **4. Additional Instructions Section**
```
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS MOTION:

1. This motion seeks summary judgment under Code of Civil Procedure Section 437c - ensure compliance with all procedural requirements including the separate statement of undisputed material facts with supporting evidence citations.

2. Structure the argument to closely follow the template format: Introduction, Statement of Facts, Legal Standard, Argument with subheadings, and Conclusion.

3. Emphasize the pattern of deliberate deception spanning multiple months (April-August 2024) to support the bad faith finding and justify punitive relief under Civil Code § 3294.

4. Cite to the recent California Supreme Court decision in Riverisland Cold Storage, Inc. v. Fresno-Madera Production Credit Ass'n (2013) 55 Cal.4th 1169 regarding the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in commercial contracts.

5. Include comprehensive analysis under the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Civil Code § 3426 et seq.) for the misappropriation claim, particularly focusing on the irreparable harm standard for injunctive relief.

6. Address Defendant's likely arguments regarding industry custom and commercial reasonableness in software development outsourcing by distinguishing cases that allow delegation with proper notice and safeguards.

7. Ensure the brief addresses the adequacy of monetary damages and establishes the four-factor test for injunctive relief: (1) likelihood of success, (2) irreparable harm, (3) balance of hardships, and (4) public interest.

8. Include a detailed section on the scope of the confidentiality breach and its ongoing competitive impact, referencing the expert economic analysis in Exhibits J and Q.

9. The tone should be professional but firm, demonstrating the severity of Defendant's misconduct while maintaining appropriate judicial restraint and respect for the Court.

10. Cross-reference all factual assertions with the separate statement of undisputed material facts and ensure all evidence citations correlate to properly authenticated exhibits in the supporting declarations.

11. Address the timing requirements under Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(a) and confirm this motion is brought at least 75 days before trial.

12. Include a brief section addressing why Defendant's cross-complaint fails as a matter of law given the material breach by CloudSystems.

13. Section 8 of the Agreement required CloudSystems to "maintain the confidentiality of all Client proprietary information and trade secrets and shall not disclose such information to any third party without appropriate confidentiality protections."

14. CloudSystems materially breached this provision by disclosing TechVentures' proprietary algorithms and technical specifications to the unauthorized subcontractors without any confidentiality agreements or protective measures.

15. Following TechVentures' discovery of these breaches on July 5, 2024, TechVentures provided written notice and a 30-day opportunity to cure pursuant to Section 12.2 of the Agreement.

16. CloudSystems failed to remedy the breaches within the cure period, forcing TechVentures to terminate the Agreement on August 20, 2024.

17. As a direct and proximate result of CloudSystems' material breaches, TechVentures has suffered damages including: (a) loss of the $150,000 advance payment; (b) additional costs of $450,000 to complete the project with a replacement vendor; (c) lost profits of approximately $1.8 million due to delayed market entry; and (d) diminished value of proprietary trade secrets.
