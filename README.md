1. Open command prompt/terminal in the project folder
2. Run: `npm test` (takes 30 seconds)
3. All tests should show "PASS" in green

> **Note**: Full browser testing (E2E) is currently under development. Core functionality is fully tested and working. See `TESTING.md` for current status.

### When to Run Quality Checks

**Always Check Before**:
- ✅ Important document generation (high-stakes cases)
- ✅ Uploading large or complex template documents
- ✅ Generating multiple prompts in succession
- ✅ Working with sensitive or confidential information

**Weekly Health Check**:
- ✅ Run quick test to ensure optimal performance
- ✅ Clear browser cache if performance seems slow
- ✅ Update browser to latest version

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem**: "Application feels slow or unresponsive"
