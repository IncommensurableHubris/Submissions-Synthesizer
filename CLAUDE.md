# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "Subs Prompt Generator" project - a tool for generating subscription-related prompts. The codebase is currently empty and awaiting initial development.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the technology stack and build tools have not yet been established. When setting up the project:

1. Determine the appropriate technology stack based on project requirements
2. Initialize the project with package.json (for Node.js) or equivalent configuration files
3. Set up build, test, and linting commands
4. Establish project structure and architecture

## Commands

No build or development commands have been established yet. This section should be updated once the project is initialized with:

- Build commands
- Test commands  
- Linting and formatting commands
- Development server commands

## Architecture

The project architecture has not been defined yet. This section should be updated to include:

- High-level system design
- Key components and their responsibilities
- Data flow and integration patterns
- Technology choices and rationale

## Notes for Future Development

- This project appears to be focused on subscription prompt generation
- Consider the target use case and user interface requirements
- Establish coding standards and development workflow
- Update this file as the project evolves with concrete implementation details
